I have created strong bonds and fun memories with my coaches and teammates that I can always look back on. Once high school ended, I auditioned for the EDGE Scholarship Program and got in. I trained in various styles of dance, 5-6 days a week for the past year and I'm continuing to learn how the dance industry works. Now, I'm pursuing a professional career in dance and I'm coaching alongside people I looked up to for the past 5 years. This year, I'm in charge of Small Hip Hop on the dance side and I couldn't be more excited!</h4>

His twin brother Pat teaches at GHS and is the yearbook and school newspaper advisor. Pat was taking pictures at the early drill team competitions and shows and brought Mike aboard to help. Starting in 2002, Pat stepped back and let Mike shoot the dance team events by himself. Mike has been the team’s photographer ever since and travels to most competitions with them. Because of the thousands of pictures taken each school year, and his brother running the yearbook and newspaper, the GHS Co-Ed Dance team receives unprecedented coverage in the school newspaper and yearbook. His favorite memories are seeing the very first performance of GHS’s very first Co-Ed team at the Fall Rally in 1998 (“Co-Ed Swing”) and then going to Nationals where they won first place, the 2009 military routine performed to his suggested song (“Jai Ho” from “Slumdog Millionaire”), Daniel Kim’s “It Gets Better” all male routine, and Tony Mac’s mind-blowing “TRON” Hip Hop routine in 2011. Mike Lancaster has received the PTSA Continuing Service Award TWICE! He is a proud graduate of John Muir High School in Pasadena, Class of 1976.</h4>

                <h4 class="text-center">My name is Cloe Fields. You can call me "Clo Clo." I was 4 year member on the team and graduated with the class of 2017. I plan to go to college and major in Film. As a child, I was given a camera, making videos has been a huge part of my life. From using an application on my PC to Adobe and creating funny YouTube videos with my cousin, to now creating weekly and promotional videos for Glendale Dance Team. In my sophomore year, my first video was "A day with Glendale Dance" at CADTD State Championships 2015 with a brief overview of the squads and award ceremony. My second video was "Road to USA Nationals" and that's where it all started. This year, I am in charge of creating new video content for the 2017-2018 team.</h4>

                <h4 class="text-center">Hi! My name is Joyce Tio. I was a four-year member of Glendale Dance/Drill Team, and graduated class of 2016. I started off as a JV member, learning the basics of the team, and worked my way up to Varsity. After graduating high school, I often visited the team to support, or help out when needed. I also loved coming back to Roosevelt Middle School to help teach kids in the dance program. Being part of the team, I’m grateful for all the valuable life lessons I’ve learned, and all the friends I’ve met. Wanting to keep in touch and stay connected with dance while trying to pursue a career in technology, I wanted to create a website for Glendale Dance/Drill Team. This year is my first year working for the team as a Consultant. I am in charge of creating, designing, and managing the team’s website, always making sure that the website is up-to-date with the current events and activities of the team. As I expand my skills as a Web Developer, the website will always be a work in progress.</h4>

                <h4 class="text-center">Hi my name is Alex Jurado! I was on the Glendale Dance Team for 4 years. In my sophomore year, I decided that I wanted to be more involved with the team. Beginning in my sophomore year and continuing until today, I have been in charge of doing all paperwork for the team, as well as planning and managing events. My senior year on the team, alongside Kelly Palmer, I planned, managed, and directed our annual competition at GHS, Glendale Games.</h4>
                <h4 class="text-center">This upcoming year I will be in charge of overseeing all the paperwork necessary for the team, such as, fundraising requests, registrations, flyers, and etc. At the same time, I will be attending school in the Fall at Seattle University, in Seattle, WA. I plan to receive a Bachelors of Arts in Humanities for Teaching in 2021. I hope to come back to Glendale High in the future to work as an educator.</h4>
                <h4 class="text-center">I will be commuting between Seattle and Glendale, coming back for special events such as Glendale Games, Glendale Regional, Nationals, etc. I am very thankful and grateful for the opportunity to still be a part of this amazing program, and am very excited for this upcoming year!</h4>
