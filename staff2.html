'14-'15 my junior year, I received captainship in charge of Large Dance/Drill alongside Micah Caro. '15-'16 I became the head captain in charge of small, medium &amp; large military. '16-'17 I decided that I loved the team and wanted be more involved by coaching and teaching kids the ropes of the team. My first year coaching I was in charge of the JV Large Military routine. Cleaning, fixing, perfecting this routine so my girls were well prepared for Nationals. They went to Nationals and got 2nd place as a Championship Large Military team. I wish to continue growing as a coach &amp; to keep watching these kids grow as dancers and young adults. Next year I'm taking on another squad, JV Small Dance/Drill as well as Large Military. This team teaches you life skills that stay with you even after high school. This team has taught me a lot &amp; will continue doing what I love, coaching.</h4>

His twin brother Pat teaches at GHS and is the yearbook and school newspaper advisor. Pat was taking pictures at the early drill team competitions and shows and brought Mike aboard to help. Starting in 2002, Pat stepped back and let Mike shoot the dance team events by himself. Mike has been the team’s photographer ever since and travels to most competitions with them. Because of the thousands of pictures taken each school year, and his brother running the yearbook and newspaper, the GHS Co-Ed Dance team receives unprecedented coverage in the school newspaper and yearbook. His favorite memories are seeing the very first performance of GHS’s very first Co-Ed team at the Fall Rally in 1998 (“Co-Ed Swing”) and then going to Nationals where they won first place, the 2009 military routine performed to his suggested song (“Jai Ho” from “Slumdog Millionaire”), Daniel Kim’s “It Gets Better” all male routine, and Tony Mac’s mind-blowing “TRON” Hip Hop routine in 2011. Mike Lancaster has received the PTSA Continuing Service Award TWICE! He is a proud graduate of John Muir High School in Pasadena, Class of 1976.</h4>

                <h4 class="text-center">Hi! My name is Joyce Tio. I was a four-year member of Glendale Dance/Drill Team, and graduated class of 2016. I started off as a JV member, learning the basics of the team, and worked my way up to Varsity. After graduating high school, I often visited the team to support, or help out when needed. I also loved coming back to Roosevelt Middle School to help teach kids in the dance program. Being part of the team, I’m grateful for all the valuable life lessons I’ve learned, and all the friends I’ve met. Wanting to keep in touch and stay connected with dance, while trying to pursue a career in technology, I wanted to create a website for Glendale Dance/Drill Team. This year is my first year working for the team as a consultant. I am in charge of creating, designing, and managing the team’s website, always making sure that the website is up-to-date with the current events and activities of the team. As I expand my skills as a Web Developer, the website will always be a work in progress.</h4>
