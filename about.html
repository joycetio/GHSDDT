                        year on the team I started off on JV learning the basics to prepare for the Varsity team the following
                        year. '14-'15 my junior year, I received captainship in charge of Large Dance/Drill alongside Micah
                        Caro. '15-'16 I became the head captain in charge of small, medium &amp; large military. '16-'17
                        I decided that I loved the team and wanted be more involved by coaching and teaching kids the ropes
                        of the team. My first year coaching I was in charge of the JV Large Military routine. Cleaning, fixing,
                        perfecting this routine so my girls were well prepared for Nationals. They went to Nationals and
                        got 2nd place as a Championship Large Military team. I wish to continue growing as a coach &amp;
                        to keep watching these kids grow as dancers and young adults. Next year I'm taking on another squad,
                        JV Small Dance/Drill as well as Large Military. This team teaches you life skills that stay with
                        you even after high school. This team has taught me a lot &amp; will continue doing what I love,
                        coaching.

                        <p class="staffBio">Hi! My name is Natalie and this will be my first year on glendale staff. I have been a glendale dance
                            drill member for four years as well as a four year soloist and earned many national titles. I
                            have trained in military style dance as well as lyrical/contemporary. I will be in charge of
                            period 4 &amp; 5 beginning dance at GHS as well as Roosevelt middle school dance. I am so excited
                            to embark on this new journey of coaching as I learn from the more seasoned coaches. As a new
                            member of staff, I will do my best to uphold the prestige and dedication Glendale Dance has conveyed
                            for over two decades.

                        <p class="staffBio" style="font-size: 17px;">Mike Lancaster saw his first Glendale High School dance show in May 1998 and was hooked. His twin
                            brother Pat teaches at GHS and is the yearbook and school newspaper advisor. Pat was taking pictures
                            at the early drill team competitions and shows and brought Mike aboard to help. Starting in 2002,
                            Pat stepped back and let Mike shoot the dance team events by himself. Mike has been the team’s
                            photographer ever since and travels to most competitions with them. Because of the thousands
                            of pictures taken each school year, and his brother running the yearbook and newspaper, the GHS
                            Co-Ed Dance team receives unprecedented coverage in the school newspaper and yearbook. His favorite
                            memories are seeing the very first performance of GHS’s very first Co-Ed team at the Fall Rally
                            in 1998 (“Co-Ed Swing”) and then going to Nationals where they won first place, the 2009 military
                            routine performed to his suggested song (“Jai Ho” from “Slumdog Millionaire”), Daniel Kim’s “It
                            Gets Better” all male routine, and Tony Mac’s mind-blowing “TRON” Hip Hop routine in 2011. Mike
                            Lancaster has received the PTSA Continuing Service Award TWICE! He is a proud graduate of John
                            Muir High School in Pasadena, Class of 1976.</p>

                            as a member of the JV team where she received her first national title. In fall of 2007, Iris
                            was promoted to the varsity team as a junior. She was a part of the Large Military team as well
                            as the coed team. Senior year Iris was promoted to captain, and was a part of the Coed, Large
                            Military, and Hip Hop teams. During her senior year, she dedicated her time figuring out how
                            the Glendale High Dance Team works behind the scenes, from event planning to costume designs.
                            In fall of 2009 Iris was hired on staff as a seamstress, and has now made and altered several
                            of the competition pieces worn throughout the past 8 years! Some of Iris's favorite memories
                            on the team include all the summer beach trips and summer training. As well as her favorite routine
                            in the 2008 Revue " Oh the Places You'll Go!" One of Iris's favorite memories on staff was making
                            the mint colored accent pieces for the all male team of 2017!</p>

                            with the class of 2017. I plan to go to college and major in film. As a child, I was given a
                            camera, making videos has been a huge part of my life. From using an app pn my pc to adobe software
                            and creating funny YouTube videos with my cousin to now creating weekly and promotional videos
                            for glendale. In my sophomore year, My first video was "A day with glendale dance" at CADTD State
                            Championships 2015 with a brief overview of the squads and award ceremony. My second video was
                            "Road to USA Nationals" and that's where it all started. I will continue to create content for
                            the new 17-18 team :)</p>

                        <p class="staffBio" style="font-size: 17px;">Hi! My name is Joyce Tio. I was a four-year member of Glendale Dance/Drill Team, and graduated class
                            of 2016. I started off as a JV member, learning the basics of the team, and worked my way up
                            to Varsity. After graduating high school, I often visited the team to support, or help out when
                            needed. I also loved coming back to Roosevelt Middle School to help teach kids in the dance program.
                            Being part of the team, I’m grateful for all the valuable life lessons I’ve learned, and all
                            the friends I’ve met. Wanting to keep in touch and stay connected with dance, while trying to
                            pursue a career in technology, I wanted to create a website for Glendale Dance/Drill Team. This
                            year is my first year working for the team as a consultant. I am in charge of creating, designing,
                            and managing the team’s website, always making sure that the website is up-to-date with the current
                            events and activities of the team. As I expand my skills as a Web Developer, the website will
                            always be a work in progress.</p>
