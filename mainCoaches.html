                    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled
                    it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                    typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
                    sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus

                                    years. My first year on the team I started off on JV learning the basics to prepare for
                                    the Varsity team the following year. '14-'15 my junior year, I received captainship in
                                    charge of Large Dance/Drill alongside Micah Caro. '15-'16 I became the head captain in
                                    charge of small, medium &amp; large military. '16-'17 I decided that I loved the team
                                    and wanted be more involved by coaching and teaching kids the ropes of the team. My first
                                    year coaching I was in charge of the JV Large Military routine. Cleaning, fixing, perfecting
                                    this routine so my girls were well prepared for Nationals. They went to Nationals and
                                    got 2nd place as a Championship Large Military team. I wish to continue growing as a
                                    coach &amp; to keep watching these kids grow as dancers and young adults. Next year I'm
                                    taking on another squad, JV Small Dance/Drill as well as Large Military. This team teaches
                                    you life skills that stay with you even after high school. This team has taught me a
                                    lot &amp; will continue doing what I love, coaching.</p>

                        <p class="staffBio" style="font-size: 17px;">Mike Lancaster saw his first Glendale High School dance show in May 1998 and was hooked. His twin
                            brother Pat teaches at GHS and is the yearbook and school newspaper advisor. Pat was taking pictures
                            at the early drill team competitions and shows and brought Mike aboard to help. Starting in 2002,
                            Pat stepped back and let Mike shoot the dance team events by himself. Mike has been the team’s
                            photographer ever since and travels to most competitions with them. Because of the thousands
                            of pictures taken each school year, and his brother running the yearbook and newspaper, the GHS
                            Co-Ed Dance team receives unprecedented coverage in the school newspaper and yearbook. His favorite
                            memories are seeing the very first performance of GHS’s very first Co-Ed team at the Fall Rally
                            in 1998 (“Co-Ed Swing”) and then going to Nationals where they won first place, the 2009 military
                            routine performed to his suggested song (“Jai Ho” from “Slumdog Millionaire”), Daniel Kim’s “It
                            Gets Better” all male routine, and Tony Mac’s mind-blowing “TRON” Hip Hop routine in 2011. Mike
                            Lancaster has received the PTSA Continuing Service Award TWICE! He is a proud graduate of John
                            Muir High School in Pasadena, Class of 1976.</p>
